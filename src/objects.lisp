;;; Mold Overview
;;;
;;; Molds act as a sort of "backend class" for objects. A mold is a separate concept from a
;;; metaobject. Their purpose is to offload the stuff that a lot of objects would share into
;;; a single object, and have many similar objects use the data stored in the mold.
;;; Right now, molds are used to keep track of direct properties and store the parents list.
;;; One big win already possible with molds is that they allow us to cache the entire
;;; precedence list for an object without having to worry about recalculating it every time
;;; a new object is created.
;;;
;;; In fact, there are two levels of caching going on; molds have their own shared data
;;; storage for 'lineages'. Lineages cache shared parent and precedence lists, and are also
;;; cached by objects, so that changes in precedence lists get propagated to children.
;;;
;;; A properties-related win is that since we hold information about *which* properties are
;;; available in the mold, our actual object instances can simply carry a lightweight vector
;;; whose slots are indexed into based on information held in the mold. This is identical to
;;; what CLOS implementations often do. Meaning? Direct property access can be as fast as
;;; CLOS' (once similar optimization strategies are implemented).
;;;
;;; There are 4 situations where molds must be handled:
;;; 1. A new object is created: in this case, find or create a new toplevel mold
;;; 2. A property is added: find or create one new transition mold
;;; 3. A property is -removed-: start from top of mold tree, find an acceptable mold
;;; 4. (setf object-parents) is called: begin from the beginning. Object may have properties.
;;;
;;; Every time a mold is switched up, care must be taken that relevant properties are copied
;;; over appropriately, and caches are reset. Additionally, when (setf object-parents) is called,
;;; all sub-molds must be alerted (and they must alert -their- sub-molds), and each sub-mold must
;;; recalculate its precedence list.
;;;
;;; One significant problem with the current transition model is that it does not try to reuse
;;; potentially similar transitions. For example, if there are two molds, A and B, an object
;;; that adds property b to mold A will transition to mold AB, whereas adding property a to
;;; mold B will transition to mold BA. Later on, this should (and -will-) be resolved.
